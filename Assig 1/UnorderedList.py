class UnorderedList:

#The statement below will have the head to be assigned with
#None when the if there are no nodes in the linked list.
#Since a new list is empty, the constructor and the check for empty must
#be consistent with one another.

    def __init__(self):
#Therefore, the statement below is made so that constructor and the check for empty
#are both consistent with each other.
#for the sake of clarification,
#the below statement is using two equal signs
#so it is a condition checking.
        self.head == None

#Meaning, two references are equal when they both point to the same thing.
