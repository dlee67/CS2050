Q:
Is there a way for me to iter and return a specific node
some how?

Q:
Also, the parent method.

Q:
On the left.find(name),

I believe that the node's method find will be
 
called,

however, I have a hard time understanding

if left: return left

and more.


Q:
In my belief,

I think I am telling my computer that 

Lisa = self.find(name)

is please go find me a node that has a name called Lisa.

Q:
Do you think that he wants us to return "Homer"?

Q:
Is there a way to go back up a node in the binary tree?

Or do I have to go around about this by using things like

iter?

A:Well, yes, sorta, I need to keep calling the parent of the

node I just called.

Q:
if self:
What does that mean?

Q:
You know you have a method that let's you print out everything?

How can I write one?

Where can I see one so I can write one.
